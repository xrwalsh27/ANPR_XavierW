1. There are three image folders: test, train, valid.
2. As you look through the code there should be adequate notes that will mark every segment and its role.
3. To run this program use the following inputs:

    * Do not use brackets around the actual folder name. This is just for the documentation
    * Everything is called through the terminal in the IDE and not run by clicking run in the IDE/codespace


    a. python DriverScript.py -i [folder name] / gives base results no added elements
    b. python DriverScript.py -i [folder name] -d 1 /allows you to run through all images with debug feature. Shows
        raw computer input. Unlike in a. this will show every image in the folder and not just the cleaned results

    c. python DriverScript.py -i [folder name] -c 1 /allows you to clean pixels around the border/ could give slightly
        different results
